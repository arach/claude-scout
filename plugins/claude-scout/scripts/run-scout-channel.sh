Scout Claude channel could not start because neither `scout` nor Bun was found on PATH.

Recommended setup:
  bun add -g @openscout/scout
  scout setup
  scout up

Fallback:
  install Bun from https://bun.sh and rerun Claude Code so this plugin can
  launch `bunx @openscout/scout channel` automatically.
